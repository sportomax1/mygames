# Universal Game Requirements

These requirements apply to all games in the My Games Hub arcade:

- **Mobile-first, iPhone-optimized design:**
  - Game containers and canvases use as much vertical space as possible, fitting the iPhone screen.
- **Responsive UI:**
  - All games adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Touch controls only:**
  - Games use tap, swipe, or drag controls. No keyboard required.
- **Disable zoom gestures:**
  - Use viewport meta tag to prevent pinch-to-zoom and double-tap zoom.
- **App-like user experience:**
  - Each game displays clear instructions on how to play when loading.
- **Visual theming:**
  - Each game has its own color palette and emoji icon.
- **Scoring and restart logic:**
  - Games include scoring systems and easy restart options where applicable.
- **Folder structure:**
  - Each game is in its own folder with `index.html`, CSS, and JS files.
- **Homepage features:**
  - Homepage lists all games with search/filter and emoji icons for quick access.

These standards ensure a consistent, enjoyable, and mobile-friendly experience across all games in your arcade.
